            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            Hello! My name is Thomas Wang and I'm a self-taught photographer from Montreal. You're looking at a collection of knowledge on photography that I've gathered over years of casual and professional shooting. I must stress at this point that I do not have any formal training in the matter. In fact, I studied biochemistry and currently work as a software developer (don't ask). My portfolio can be found at the bottom of this page along with some of my other work.
            <br><br>
            This guide is intended for those looking for the basics to photography without dipping too much into the details.
            <br><br>
            <h1>The exposure</h1>
            Before anything, some basic theory is needed. There are three elements behind each exposure: <b>aperture</b>, <b>shutter speed</b> and <b>ISO</b>.
            <br><br>
            The cumulated effects of the three dictate the "brightness" of an image. The aperture is the opening in the lens used to control the amount of light that enters the camera. The shutter is a mechanical curtain that shields the sensor from light and the shutter speed is the period of time the sensor is exposed to the lens. Finally, the ISO is the sensitivity of the receptors in the sensor and determines how much light is required to excite them.
            <br><br>
            Note that a ray of light will encounter each factor in the same order they were described above: Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO.
            <br><br>
            Now, the three elements combined will tell how "bright" a picture is. As you've likely realized by now, there are many ways to achieve the same "brightness". For instance, if we decrease the size of the aperture, less light enters the camera. We may compensate for this by either increasing the sensitivity (ISO) of the sensor or by increasing the time it's exposed (shutter speed).
            <br><br>
            The latter may seem a little odd, so let's consider the following analogy: buckets placed under a faucet. The goal here is to fill any bucket regardless of how it's done. Three factors influence this simple objective: the size of the faucet (aperture), the time the faucet is left running (shutter speed) and the capacity of the bucket (ISO). Given a smaller than average faucet, it would take longer to fill a standard bucket compared to a regular faucet. However, the small faucet would take less time to fill a smaller bucket.
            <br><br>
            When the aperture is reduced, you may compensate by decreasing the shutter speed or by increasing the ISO. As such, the three elements must be carefully balanced to achieve correct image "brightness".
            <br><br>
            Before concluding this section, let's consider a simple experiment. First, place a fan (or any rapidly rotating object) in a well lit room. This works best if the fan is placed in front of something that contrasts strongly with the blades. Place yourself in front and turn it on. Blink slowly. The blades should blur as the fan speeds up. Then, blink quickly. If the conditions are right, you should momentarily see a still image of the blades! In this experiment, blinking slowly (slow shutter speed) leads to blurring of the blades while blinking rapidly (fast shutter) will freeze a moment.
            <br><br>
            <h1>The image</h1>
            The discussion thus far has largely been focused on the "brightness" of an exposure but has ignored its content. This section describes the additional (and more important) properties of ISO, shutter speed and aperture. We will also introduce a new element: the focal length. 
            <br><br>
            The ISO is the most subtle of the bunch and affects the noise level and dynamic range of an image. Noise refers to the graininess in a picture while the dynamic range defines the range between light and dark a sensor is able to capture. Shooting at higher ISOs means more grain or nosier pictures and means poorer dynamic range or images that feel more "flat". Generally, raising the ISO rating leads to image degradation and, as such, ISO should be kept as low as possible. This setting has relatively minimal impact on the final image. I set it to compensate for my shutter speed and aperture settings.
            <br><br>
            The remaining elements each affect a different type of "blur".
            <br><br>
            Shutter speed regulates motion blur. As the experiment above suggested, a slow shutter speed leads to blurring while a faster freezes a changing frame. Ever wonder why our phones take blurrier pictures in poorly lit rooms? Shutter speed is the culprit here. When there is little light available, your phone (on automatic mode) will slow down the shutter in order to give the sensor more time to collect light. However, this gives time for the either the subject or your phone to move leading to motion blur.
            <br><br>
            The aperture controls the depth-of-field or DOF of an exposure. The DOF can be described as how much an image blurs as we look away from the focus point. A shallow DOF, associated with large apertures, means a large transition between focus and blur while a deeper DOF minimizes this transition.
