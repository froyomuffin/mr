            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            Hello! My name is Thomas Wang and I'm a self-taught photographer from Montreal. You're looking at a collection of knowledge on photography that I've gathered over years of casual and professional shooting. I must stress at this point that I do not have any formal training in the matter. In fact, I studied biochemistry and currently work as a software developer (don't ask). My portfolio can be found at the bottom of this page along with some of my other work.
            <br><br>
            This guide is intended for those looking for the basics to photography without dipping too much into the details.
            <br><br>
            <h1>The exposure</h1>
            Before anything, some basic theory is needed. There are three elements behind each exposure: Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO.
            <br><br>
            The cumulated effects of the three dictate the "brightness" of an image. The aperture is the opening in the lens used to control the amount of light that enters the camera. The shutter is a mechanical curtain that shields the sensor from light and the shutter speed is the period of time the sensor is exposed to the lens. Finally, the ISO is the sensitivity of the receptors in the sensor and determines how much light is required to excite them.
            <br><br>
            Note that a ray of light will encounter each factor in the same order they were described above: Aperture, Shutter Speed and ISO.
            <br><br>
            Now, the three elements combined will tell how "bright" a picture is. As you've likely realized by now, there are many ways to achieve the same "brightness". For instance, if we decrease the size of the aperture, less light enters the camera. We may compensate for this by either increasing the sensitivity (ISO) of the sensor or by increasing the time it's exposed (shutter speed).
            <br><br>
            The latter may seem a little odd, so let's consider the following analogy: buckets placed under a faucet. The goal here is to fill any bucket regardless of how it's done. Three factors influence this simple objective: the size of the faucet (aperture), the time the faucet is left running (shutter speed) and the capacity of the bucket (ISO). Given a smaller than average faucet, it would take longer to fill a standard bucket compared to a regular faucet. However, the small faucet would take less time to fill a smaller bucket.
            <br><br>
            When the aperture is reduced, you may compensate by decreasing the shutter speed or by increasing the ISO. 
            <br><br>
            Before continuing, let's take the analogy just a little bit further. What would happen if two buckets were placed next to one another and a running hose was swinged over them? Well, if the hose was moved slowly, it would fill one bucket before passing over the other. In contrast, if the hose was wiped around, it would take a few swings before either bucket is filled. This example is analagous to an object moving back and forth in front of a camera and suggests that the elements of an exposure have other effects. 
            <br><br>
            <h1>The image</h1>
            The discussion so far has been limited to "brightness" of a picture and has largely ignored how they affect the actual content of an image. The extended analogy given above was <strike>fugly</strike> confusing so let's consider a real life experiment.
            <br><br>
            First, place a fan (or any rapidly rotating object) in a well lit room. This works best if the fan is placed in front of something that contrasts strongly with the blades. Place yourself in front and turn it on. Blink slowly. The blades should blur as the fan speeds up. Then, blink quickly. If the conditions are right, you should momentarily see a still image of the blades! This experiment illustrates that blinking slowly (slow shutter speed) leads to blurring of the blades while blinking rapidly (fast shutter) will freeze a dynamic frame.
            <br><br>
            The additonal properties of the elements of an exposure affect various qualities of an image. The ISO influences the noise in an image as well as its dynamic range. The dynamic range is the range of light and dark that a sensor can capture. The higher the ISO, the noisier the image and the more poorer the dynamic range. The shutter speed affects the motion blur (or lack of). Slow shutter speeds will lead to blurring while faster speeds will "freeze the moment". Last, and most complex, is the aperture.
